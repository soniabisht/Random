This is the competitors calculator. Thatâ€™s how they want it to function but they want it to me in their design:

Mobile: https://tzqalw.axshare.com/#g=1&id=47lmed&p=concept_2f
Desktop: https://tzqalw.axshare.com/#g=1&id=s70wim&p=concept_2f_1

Need a price and eta on just doing the calculator. They will to the rest.

Also a price and ETA on doing the whole landing page
